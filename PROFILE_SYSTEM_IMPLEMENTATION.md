# Complete User Profile & Onboarding System - Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved
You requested a complete user profile system that:
- Shows an onboarding form for new users after first successful sign-up
- Collects comprehensive profile information and stores it in MongoDB
- Redirects to dashboard after profile completion
- Loads and displays profile data on subsequent logins

## âœ… Implementation Completed

### 1. Backend API (NestJS + MongoDB)
**Files Created/Updated:**
- `apps/api/src/users/users.module.ts` - User module configuration
- `apps/api/src/users/users.controller.ts` - API endpoints for profile operations
- `apps/api/src/users/users.service.ts` - Business logic for profile management
- `apps/api/src/users/schemas/user-profile.schema.ts` - MongoDB schema
- `apps/api/src/users/dto/user-profile.dto.ts` - Data validation DTOs
- `apps/api/src/app.module.ts` - Added UsersModule to main app

**API Endpoints Created:**
- `POST /users/profile` - Create new user profile
- `GET /users/profile/:clerkUserId` - Get user profile
- `PUT /users/profile/:clerkUserId` - Update user profile
- `GET /users/profile/:clerkUserId/check-onboarding` - Check onboarding status

### 2. Frontend Components (React + Clerk)
**Files Created:**
- `apps/web/src/pages/ProfileOnboardingPage.tsx` - Complete 5-step onboarding form
- `apps/web/src/pages/DynamicDashboard.tsx` - Smart dashboard with profile integration
- Updated `apps/web/src/App.tsx` - Added new routes

### 3. Profile Data Structure
The system collects exactly what you requested:

**Required Fields:**
- Name (auto-filled from Clerk)
- Roll number
- Age  
- Address
- College email (auto-filled from Clerk, non-editable)
- Personal email
- College name
- Academic year
- Mobile number
- CGPA

**Optional Fields:**
- Projects (title, description, technologies, GitHub links)
- Resume upload placeholder
- Certifications (name, issuer, date, credential ID, verification URL)
- Skills (multiple)
- Achievements (list)

**Non-Editable Fields (as requested):**
- Name
- College email
- College name

## ðŸ”„ User Flow

### New User Journey:
1. User signs up with Clerk â†’ redirected to `/onboarding` (configured in .env.local)
2. 5-step profile completion form:
   - Personal Information
   - Contact Details  
   - Academic Information
   - Skills & Projects
   - Achievements & Certifications
3. Data saved to MongoDB with `isOnboardingComplete: true`
4. Redirected to dashboard

### Returning User Journey:
1. User signs in â†’ redirected to `/dashboard`
2. Dashboard checks onboarding status via API
3. If profile exists â†’ loads and displays profile data
4. If no profile â†’ redirects to onboarding
