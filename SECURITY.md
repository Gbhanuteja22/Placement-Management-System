# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by emailing the maintainers directly rather than opening a public issue.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Never commit sensitive data** including:
   - Database connection strings with credentials
   - API keys or tokens
   - Passwords or secrets
   - Personal information

2. **Use environment variables** for all configuration:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Update with your actual credentials
   - Never commit `.env` files

3. **Keep dependencies updated**:
   - Regularly run `npm audit`
   - Update vulnerable packages promptly

4. **Code review**: All changes should be reviewed for security issues

### For Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**: Use secure environment variable management
2. **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production
3. **Database Security**: Restrict database access to specific IPs
4. **Regular Backups**: Maintain secure, regular database backups
5. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for unusual activity

## Common Security Issues to Avoid

- ❌ Hardcoded credentials in source code
- ❌ Committing `.env` files
- ❌ Using weak or default passwords
- ❌ Exposing sensitive APIs without authentication
- ❌ Running with unnecessary permissions

## Incident Response

If credentials are accidentally exposed:

1. **Immediately** rotate all affected credentials
2. **Review** access logs for unauthorized activity
3. **Update** all systems with new credentials
4. **Notify** team members if applicable
5. **Document** the incident and prevention measures
