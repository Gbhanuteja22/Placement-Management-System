## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start all services (Frontend + Backend)
npm run dev

# Start just the frontend
cd apps/web && npm run dev

# Start just the backend  
cd apps/api && npm run dev

# Start database services
npm run docker:dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Features
1. **Database Changes**: Update `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`
2. **Backend**: Add modules in `apps/api/src/modules/`
3. **Frontend**: Add pages/components in `apps/web/src/`
4. **Types**: Update shared types in `packages/types/`

### Code Quality
- TypeScript compilation: `npm run typecheck`
- Linting: `npm run lint`  
- Formatting: `npm run format`
- Testing: `npm test`
