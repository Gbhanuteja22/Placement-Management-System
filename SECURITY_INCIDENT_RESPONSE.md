# üö® URGENT: MongoDB Security Breach Response

## What Happened
Your MongoDB Atlas credentials were exposed in the GitHub repository in the following files:
- `apps/api/test-mongo.js` (now deleted)
- `process.txt` (now deleted) 
- `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` (now deleted)

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. üîÑ Rotate MongoDB Credentials (CRITICAL)

**Step 1: Change Database Password**
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
2. Navigate to your cluster ‚Üí Database Access
3. Find user `placementuser`
4. Click "Edit" ‚Üí "Edit Password"
5. Generate a new strong password
6. Update the password

**Step 2: Update Network Access (Optional but Recommended)**
1. Go to Network Access
2. Review IP whitelist entries
3. Remove any unnecessary IPs
4. Consider restricting to specific IPs instead of 0.0.0.0/0

**Step 3: Monitor Database Activity**
1. Go to Monitoring tab
2. Check for any suspicious activity
3. Review connection logs

### 2. üîß Update Your Local Environment

**Create your local .env file:**
```bash
cd apps/api
cp .env.example .env
```

**Update apps/api/.env with your new credentials:**
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://placementuser:YOUR_NEW_PASSWORD@your-cluster.mongodb.net/placement_management?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
```

### 3. üîç API Keys Review

The following API keys were also exposed and should be rotated:

**Adzuna API:**
- App ID: `7a4449e5`
- API Key: `0047fc9cf16077a7bd1ee1bfba23f87e`

**Actions:**
1. Go to [Adzuna Developer Portal](https://developer.adzuna.com/)
2. Generate new API credentials
3. Update your .env file

### 4. ‚úÖ Verification Steps

After rotating credentials:
1. Test local development: `npm run dev`
2. Verify database connection works
3. Test API endpoints
4. Confirm no unauthorized access to your MongoDB cluster

### 5. üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Measures

**Already Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ Environment variables for sensitive data
- ‚úÖ .env files in .gitignore
- ‚úÖ .env.example templates
- ‚úÖ README security guidelines

**Additional Recommendations:**
- Use GitHub's secret scanning alerts
- Set up MongoDB Atlas alerting for unusual activity
- Regular security audits of your repositories
- Use GitHub branch protection rules

### 6. üìû Emergency Contacts

If you notice any suspicious database activity:
- MongoDB Atlas Support: [support portal](https://support.mongodb.com/)
- Change all passwords immediately
- Consider creating a new database cluster

## Timeline

- **Immediate** (within 1 hour): Rotate MongoDB password
- **Within 24 hours**: Rotate API keys
- **Ongoing**: Monitor for suspicious activity

## Status Checklist

- [ ] MongoDB password rotated
- [ ] Local .env file updated with new credentials
- [ ] Application tested with new credentials
- [ ] Adzuna API keys rotated (if using)
- [ ] MongoDB activity monitored
- [ ] Team/stakeholders notified
